# fdtd1d

## A parallel one dimensional FDTD code for Maxwell equations. 

Finite difference time domain (FDTD) is one of the most efficient numerical
techniques for solving electromagnetic problems. It can handle a vast number
of practical electromagnetic problems such as electromagnetic interaction with
non-linear, dispersive, anisotropic and time varying media.

This code demonstrates how to write a concurrent FDTD using modern C++ features.

To compile and run:

'''
$ cd build 
$ cmake .. 
$ make     
$ ./fdtd1d 
'''
